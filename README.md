# Danylo Portfolio — Tabs + CV

This site now includes a professional tabbed profile section with an embedded CV.

## Add your CV PDF
Place your PDF in the workspace at:

```
assets/Danylo Kovalenko CV .pdf
```

Notes:
- The current embed expects the file name with spaces: `Danylo Kovalenko CV .pdf`.
- Alternatively, rename to `Danylo-Kovalenko-CV.pdf` and update the links in `index.html`.

## Quick preview
Open `index.html` directly in your browser. Tabs will show About, Experience, Skills, and the CV viewer.

## Next steps (optional)
- Share more details from your CV (Experience, Education, Skills) and I’ll populate the tabs with exact info.
- If you prefer a different font (e.g., `Plus Jakarta Sans`), I can switch it.
